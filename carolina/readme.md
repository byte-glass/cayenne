## latest

 - src/b.ml and src/c.ml -- functional style i.e. tail rec, seems to work

 - src/a.ml -- early working version in imperative style
 - write function to read all available `Threshold` messages from the channel
 - have workers run over slices of an array
 - have fun tally spawn workers, try more imperative style if it makes workers fall out more easily

 - tidy up src/v0
 - logging and more than one worker - behaviour still baffling

## next steps

 - move towards fun k_least returning array(?)
 - how to set up tests
 - get better acquainted with dune see https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quick-start.html
