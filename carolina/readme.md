## latest

 - src/a.ml - tally spawns workers, two way communication seems to work.

 - tidy up src/v0
 - logging and more than one worker - behaviour still baffling

## next steps

 - have workers run over slices of an array
 - have fun tally spawn workers, try more imperative style if it makes workers fall out more easily

 - how to set up tests
 - get better acquainted with dune see https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quick-start.html
